### Expense Manager Web Application

I developed a comprehensive Expense Manager web application (named **Expense Desk** ) as my Graduation Final Year project back in year 2020. Powered by Python and Django, the application efficiently handles all business logic, while PostgreSQL ensures secure and organized data storage.

**Key Features:**
- **User-Friendly Expense Tracking:** Users can effortlessly log day-to-day expenses across various categories, including Shopping, Medical, Bills and Fees, Travel, Beauty, Food, Entertainment, and more.

- **Intelligent Graphical Representations:** The application provides insightful graphical representations of expenses based on Expense Type, Monthly, and Weekly breakdowns. This visual analysis aids users in understanding spending patterns and assists in budget management.

- **Data Security:** User credentials are prioritized, employing AES256 encryption for enhanced security, ensuring the protection of sensitive information.

This Expense Manager is designed to empower users with a simple yet effective tool to monitor their expenditures, offering valuable insights for better financial planning and management.
